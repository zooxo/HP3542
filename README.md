HP3542 - The Legendary HP-35 RPN Calculator for the DM42 Hardware

Emulates the HP-35 (CPU and ROM) on the Swissmicros DM42
Version 1.0, (c) 2022 by deetee/zooxo
This software is covered by the 3-clause BSD license.

In January 1972, Hewlett-Packard introduced with the HP-35 the first scientific
pocket calculator with transcendental functions and revolutionized the way to
calculate. 2011 Pietro de Luca created (based on the work of Peter Monta and
Jacques Laporte) a port of the reverse engineered HP-35 ROM for AVR
microcontroller.

HP3542 uses this HP35-ROM-Engine to offer the calculation power of the HP-35 to
the DM42 calculator of Swissmicros (with finally less then 9 Kilobytes).

Have fun!
